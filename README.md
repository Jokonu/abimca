# Autoencoder Based Iterative Modeling and Subsequence Clustering Algorithm (ABIMCA)

This repository contains the python code for the Autoencoder Based Iterative Modeling and Subsequence Clustering Algorithm (ABIMCA)[^koehn] which is a deep learning method to separate multivariate time-series data (MTSD) into subsequences. It is beneficial in a variety of fields, to cluster MTSD into smaller segments or subsequences in an unsupervised manner. The ability to filter measurement data based on specific subsequences can improve downstream development products such as anomaly detection or machine diagnosis in condition based maintenance (CbM) strategies. Our algorithm is specifically useful for MTSD generated by a mechatronic system in a transient environment. It can be used offline as well as online for streaming data. It utilizes recurrent neural network (RNN) based Autoencoders (AE) by iteratively training a Base Autoencoder (BAE), generating a segmentation score and saving the intermediate parameters of the BAE to recognize previously identified subsequences.
